# LinearAlgebra
A library for doing general exploration in linear algebra

7 mar 2015
Currently some basic constructors for vectors exist, and the the following methods for vectors (see javadocs):

dotProduct
getType (either int or double data types in vector)
getMagnitude
scalar (multiplying a vector by a scalar)
zeroVector
crossProduct (currently buggy)
