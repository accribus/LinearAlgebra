# LinearAlgebra
A library for doing general exploration in linear algebra

Currently some basic constructors for vectors exist, and the the following methods for vectors (see javadocs):

dotProduct
getType (either int or double data types in vector)
getMagnitude
scalar (multiplying a vector by a scalar)
zeroVector
crossProduct (buggy)

8 mar 2016
fixed crossProduct
plan to add a findVector() that generates a vector from point A to point B in n-dimensional space
updated the test file with cleaner code
